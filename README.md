My Yaudins brothers!

"Hello, my name is Douglas Lucio, known as dlucioyauh. I am on the path to becoming a developer, with a passion for creating solutions for both front-end and back-end.

My journey includes exploring different technologies and languages. I'm always eager to learn more and expand my skill set.

Furthermore, I am committed to creating intuitive and functional user experiences combined with behind-the-scenes robustness and efficiency.

I'm excited to continue learning, collaborate on challenging projects, and contribute to the world of technology as a developer. If you share this passion or need a partner for your projects, I'm ready to work together!"
