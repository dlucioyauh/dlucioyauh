## About me

"Hello, I'm Douglas Lucio, or dlucio to my friends. I'm on the path to becoming a full stack developer, with a passion for creating solutions for both the front-end and back-end.

My journey includes exploring different technologies and languages, from HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, to Python, Node.js and SQL for the back end. I am always eager to learn more and expand my skill set.

Furthermore, I am committed to creating intuitive and functional user experiences combined with behind-the-scenes robustness and efficiency.

I'm excited to continue learning, collaborate on challenging projects, and contribute to the world of technology as a full stack developer. If you share this passion or need a partner for your projects, I'm ready to work together!"
